Time Series Customer Sales Report - Power BI Project
Overview
The Time Series Customer Sales Report project is designed to track and analyze customer sales trends over time. By visualizing sales patterns, seasonality, and long-term growth, this dashboard enables business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, forecast future sales, and identify key factors driving customer purchase behavior.

Key Features
Sales Trend Analysis: Visualize how sales evolve over time (daily, monthly, yearly trends).
Seasonality Detection: Identify recurring patterns, spikes, or dips in sales due to seasonality.
Customer Purchase Behavior: Track individual customer sales activity over specific time periods.
Forecasting: Leverage time series analysis to predict future sales trends.
Sales by Segment: Break down sales by customer segment, product type, or geographic region.
Data Sources
Customer Data: Customer demographics and profiles.
Sales Data: Historical sales transactions including date, product, quantity, and revenue.
Product Data: Details about product categories, pricing, and inventory.
Calendar Data: Date table to support time series analysis (day, month, quarter, year breakdown).
Power BI Components
Dashboard: Provides a high-level view of sales trends, forecasting, and seasonality.
Reports: Drill-down reports on customer sales by segment, geography, or product category.
Time Series Visualizations: Line charts, bar charts, and area graphs to track trends over time.
Filters: Dynamic filters for adjusting time periods, customer segments, and product categories.
Insights & Analysis
Sales Trends: Identify the growth or decline of sales over specific periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
Seasonal Patterns: Detect peak sales periods (e.g., holidays, events) and predict recurring sales cycles.
Customer Behavior: Analyze how frequently customers make purchases, their average transaction value, and lifetime value.
Forecasting: Utilize predictive models (e.g., exponential smoothing or ARIMA) to project future sales performance.
Revenue by Segment: Determine which customer segments or regions contribute the most to overall sales.
Usage
Time Filters: Select different time frames (last 7 days, last month, current year) to adjust the report views.
Drill-Through: Drill through from high-level sales trends to detailed individual customer transactions.
Custom Date Ranges: Use slicers to choose specific start and end dates for customized time series analysis.
Exports: Reports can be exported in PDF, Excel, or CSV format for external reporting or detailed analysis.
Setup
Data Import: Import customer, sales, and product data into Power BI. Ensure data is clean, structured, and time-stamped.
Data Modeling: Create relationships between the sales, customer, product, and calendar tables to enable time series analysis.
Time Intelligence: Implement time intelligence functions (YTD, MTD, YOY growth) for comparative analysis over different time periods.
Visualization: Build visual components such as line charts for time series, bar charts for sales by segment, and area charts for cumulative sales.
Testing: Ensure accuracy in date-based calculations and validate visual interactivity before publishing.
